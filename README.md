## Development

We would use `node` version `14.9.0`

The first time, you will need to run

```
npm install
```

Then just start the server with

```
npm run start
```

It uses nodemon for livereloading :peace-fingers:

# API Validation

By using [celebrate](https://github.com/arb/celebrate), the req.body schema becomes cleary defined at route level, so even frontend devs can read what an API endpoint expects without needing to write documentation that can get outdated quickly.

```js
route.post(
  '/signup',
  celebrate({
    body: Joi.object({
      name: Joi.string().required(),
      email: Joi.string().required(),
      password: Joi.string().required(),
    }),
  }),
  controller.signup
);
```

**Example error**

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "message": "child \"email\" fails because [\"email\" is required]"
  }
}
```

## API Documentation

Postman would be used for the API Documentation. I'll search for an integration and implement it

'no-underscore-dangle': ['error', { allow: ['_place'] }],s
